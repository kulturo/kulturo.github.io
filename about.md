I want to get into the habit of writing.  Perhaps others will find what I write interesting, but that would be a bonus.  I haven't decided how much personal information I want to share yet, but here is something:
* I am a generalist, I'm interested in loads of things and not expert in any of them
* I'm a civil servant, and the civil service has its own definition of expert.  In that definition I'm an expert in lots of things
 * I'm aware enough to know that I'm not really though...
 * I'm also aware that I suffer from imposter syndrome, so maybe I am really?
* I have masters-level qualifications in both natural and social science
* I love languages, but I'm not great at learning them
* I can code (Python is my preference) and am interested in data-driven projects

### Contact

You can contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/_kulturo_), and I'll set up an email address too at some point.  I'll also set up comments on hear sometime... maybe - it depends ;)
